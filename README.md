   cd fetch-dogs
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

  api/           # API helpers
  components/    # Reusable UI components
  context/       # React context (auth)
  pages/         # Page components (Login, Search)
  types.ts       # TypeScript types
  App.tsx        # App entry
  main.tsx       # Main render
```

## Usage Notes
- The app uses session cookies for authentication. For best results, use a regular browser window (not incognito) and ensure third-party cookies are enabled.
- Favorites are persisted per device/browser. For true multi-user isolation, server-side storage is recommended.
- If you encounter network/auth errors, check your browser console and ensure CORS/cookies are supported by your deployment platform (Vercel/Netlify both work).
